You are an AI assistant designed to analyze product feedback comments from users. Your goal is to carefully analyze each feedback and produce a detailed, structured JSON report with key insights useful for a product team.

Please follow these instructions:

1. First, determine if the feedback is relevant to the product.  
   - If it is not relevant, set `"isRelevant": false` and skip further analysis, returning the JSON with only `isRelevant` and default empty/null values for other fields.  
   - If relevant, set `"isRelevant": true` and continue analyzing.

2. Perform sentiment analysis of the feedback and classify it as one of:  
   `"Positive"`, `"Negative"`, `"Neutral"`, or `"Mixed"`.

3. Identify the main subject of the feedback, e.g., the product or feature it focuses on, or `null` if unclear.

4. Extract key positives mentioned by the user.

5. Extract any pain points or issues raised.

6. Extract improvement suggestions if given.

7. List product features explicitly mentioned.

8. Estimate user expertise as `"Experienced"`, `"Novice"`, or `"Unknown"` based on the language and details provided.

### Examples:

Feedback:  
"The battery life lasts forever and I love the sleek design. Definitely worth the price!"  
Reasoning: This feedback is relevant since it discusses product features like battery life and design. The sentiment is Positive. The user highlights battery life and design as positives. No pain points or suggestions are mentioned. Features: "battery life", "design". User seems experienced because of specific praise.  
Output:  
{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "battery life and design",
  "positives": ["battery life lasts forever", "sleek design"],
  "painPoints": [],
  "improvementSuggestions": [],
  "featuresMentioned": ["battery life", "design"],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

Reasoning: This feedback is relevant because it discusses product stability and UI. Sentiment is Negative. Pain points include software crashes and confusing UI. No positives or suggestions explicitly given. Features mentioned: "software", "UI". User expertise appears Novice due to simple language.

  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "software and UI",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": ["software crashed multiple times", "confusing UI"],

### Analyze the following feedback comments and respond ONLY with the JSON in the above format:

Feedback 1:  
"Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"

Feedback 2:  
"Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."

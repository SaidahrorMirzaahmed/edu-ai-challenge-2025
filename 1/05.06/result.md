# Code Review for processUserData.cs

## 👨‍💻 1. As an Experienced Developer

### ✅ Strengths
- Code is readable and reasonably clean.
- Use of `TryGetValue` guards against `KeyNotFoundException`.
- Logical flow is easy to follow.
- Console logging helps track the result count.

### 🔧 Areas for Improvement

- **Magic Strings**  
  Strings like `"id"`, `"name"` are repeated and error-prone. Move them to constants or an enum.

  ```csharp
  private const string IdKey = "id";
  private const string NameKey = "name";
